# Salesforce Graph Algorithm Application
This application is designed to demonstrate how to implement a graph and graph algorithms in Salesforce. The specific use case in this application is finding the closest medical appointment slots for different medical specialties.

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Deploy the code to your Salesforce org using your preferred deployment tool.

## Usage
TODO

## Graph Algorithm Implementation

In this application, the medical appointment slots are represented as nodes in a graph, and the time between them is represented as the weight of the edges. The graph algorithm used to find the closest appointments is Dijkstra's algorithm.
